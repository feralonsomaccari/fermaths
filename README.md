# Fer Maths

A little *Chrome plugin* tool I use to practice basic arithmetic whenever I’m bored. It’s super easy to use and makes sharpening my math skills feel simple and accessible, without any hassle.

I’ve also mapped it to Ctrl + 4 in my Chrome, so I can access it super fast.

Feel free to try this plugin! To use it locally, first build it, then load it as an unpacked extension in the Chrome Extensions tab.
